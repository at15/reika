# Version 0.1

Mainly modeled after [Q](http://code.kx.com/q/) and [Juttle](https://github.com/juttle/juttle)

## TODO

- [ ] immutable, or not?

## Goals

- dynamic typing when used in notebook (ayatonotebook) or shell (irk)
- static typing when the entire program and schema of data source is provided, translate to Java, Go or LLVM IR, CUDA?
- a SQL like sub language to operate on table (in memory only, data from other source need to be loaded first)

## Non Goals

- user defined functions
- error handling
- recursive function (we don't allow user to define function ...)
- recursive type
- `\t` that run the action and collection metrics

## Operators

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` as they normally are, broadcast when apply scalar on list
- `:=` for assignment that allocate storage

## Example

- generate random stock tickers as in [Q's example](http://code.kx.com/q4m3/1_Q_Shock_and_Awe/#117-example-trades-table)
- plot graph in notebook (might support saving to file in compiled program?)
- save in memory data to csv
